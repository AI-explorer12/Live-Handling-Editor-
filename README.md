# HandlingEditor
Live handling editor for FiveM

Start script, then type command /handling [handling name] to open menu (e.g. /handling police). You have to be inside vehicle to use command, after typing /handling command you can open menu with F7.
You can use the stats icon on the left side to view the vehicles current stats such as (Horsepower, Torque, Braking Distance, Average Traction,and Agility Value) you can also use the "Start Performance Test" button to track the vehicles times. If you are unsure what a certain value does click the more info window which will allow you to click on the value you are unsure about and it will display a definition and some examples of how the value effects the car. When you finish customizing your handling you can copy it to the clipboard (by clicking on Export), and paste it into handling.meta file (from fMass to nMonetaryValue) ;)
(You need command.handling permission to use the handling editor. If you don't want permission system to be active - set `true` to `false` in LiveHandlingEditor_sv.lua 5th line)
